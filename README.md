# Cyclone Risk Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project provides a **Cyclone Risk Analysis Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**. The dashboard visualizes and analyzes cyclone-related data, helping users understand cyclone occurrences, risk levels, and affected regions.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: Displays cyclone paths with risk levels.
- **Data Filtering**: Select by date, location, and risk level.
- **Statistical Insights**: Shows key metrics on cyclone frequency and impact.
- **Graphical Representations**: Includes bar charts, time series plots, and heatmaps.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive experience.

## Installation
To run the dashboard locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyclone-risk-dashboard.git
   cd cyclone-risk-dashboard
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
